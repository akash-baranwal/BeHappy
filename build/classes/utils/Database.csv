MotivationalStory, Elizabeth Sherrill,Abraham Lincoln: A Courage Born of Depression,Abraham Lincoln knew great loss and deep sorrow throughout his life; and it may be that his lifelong melancholia gave him the strength to handle the crises of his years as president.,"It was my grandfather who gave me a lifelong love of Abraham Lincoln, one that was to help me in a way he could never have imagined. As a boy of seven, Grandfather had seen the funeral train carrying Lincoln’s body home to Springfield, Illinois. From that moment, sobbing by the tracks, he’d taken Lincoln as the model for his own life of battling injustice. I was seven when Grandfather gave me my first book about Lincoln. In Abraham Lincoln, the Backwoods Boy, I read about the son of a near-illiterate farmer, walking miles through the snow to borrow a book. Straining his eyes to read by firelight because he had to work in the fields in the daytime. Starting to write and getting whipped when his father caught him “scribbling” instead of feeding the pigs. Lincoln went right on writing. This determined boy became my model too. I started writing, and when I had to stop to set the dinner table I was sure Lincoln would have understood my feelings. At eight, I went to a new school. I remember going for the first time to its library, much bigger than the one in my old school, with quiet signs on the tables and portraits on the walls. Over the librarian’s desk was a color photograph of the president, Franklin Roosevelt, seated at his desk. On the right wall was a painting of George Washington standing by a cannon; on the left was one of Thomas Jefferson, holding the Declaration of Independence. But it was the picture over the door, when I turned to leave with my new library card, that stopped me. It was a photograph, this one black-and-white: a tall, thin man with his hand on a table and with the saddest, most pain-filled face I’d ever seen. The gold letters on the frame said Abraham Lincoln. It couldn’t be! Lincoln, my brave hero, who won every wrestling match? The ragged boy who told such funny stories that crowds would gather to listen? They’d put the wrong name on the photograph. But of course it was Lincoln, and over time that portrait made him more important to me than ever. Already I was experiencing the bouts of depression that, three years later, would lead my parents to the then-rare step of taking me to a psychiatrist. Despite her help, I continued to have (and still do) occasional descents into those bottomless depths. And at these times, my model continued to be Abraham Lincoln. My depression had no discernible cause. His had many. The death of an infant brother was not unusual for those times. But his mother’s death was as traumatic an experience as any nine-year-old could have. In the family’s one-room cabin, there was no escaping her agonies from milk sickness, a disease then ravaging their Indiana frontier community. People who ingested milk or meat from cows that had fed on the white snakeroot plant suffered uncontrollable shaking, hideous stomach pains, continuous retching. For a week, Lincoln’s mother tossed in torture on her bed, her tongue turned black, unable even to speak words of farewell. Abraham had one surviving sibling, a brilliant sister named Sarah, who was two years older and his closest companion. Abe was 18 when Sarah gave birth to a stillborn child and died. At 22 and, in his own words, “friendless, uneducated and penniless,” Lincoln left the family farm to strike out on his own in Illinois. That this disadvantaged young man was able to carve out a career for himself as a lawyer seems marvel enough. The fact that he did it while carrying the burden of depression was what astonished me. “Lincoln was a sad, gloomy man, a man of sorrow,” his long-time friend and law partner said, noting once that “his melancholy dripped from him as he walked.” Even after his successful run for a seat in the Illinois state legislature, his sense of dejection did not lift. When a bill he’d worked for was defeated, he wrote to a friend, “I am finished forever.” How familiar I was with this I’ve-failed-and-now-it’s-hopeless feeling! And yet…as despairing as he felt, Lincoln somehow managed to succeed in every way that mattered. It wasn’t that his depression went away. An artist working at the White House in the final year of Lincoln’s life remembered that “Mr. Lincoln had the saddest face I ever attempted to paint.” By my own late twenties, when my depression became incapacitating, reading about Lincoln’s life was a pathway back to the functioning world. Sometimes all I could do was stare at a photograph of his downcast face. Yet in the strange psychology of depression, this cheered me. If Lincoln could accomplish so much while feeling so bad, surely I could get up and do a little. It was not until many years later that I began to see something even more life-giving in Lincoln’s story. Many times in accounts of his life, I’d noticed references to his melancholia. Now I came upon the definition of that word as used in the 19th century: fear and sadness without apparent cause. Without cause? But Lincoln had so many reasons to be depressed! They’d only multiplied throughout his life, culminating in the death of his two little sons and the terrible slaughter of the Civil War. But his melancholia suggested something more, something closer to the medical condition recognized today as clinical, or persistent, irrational depression. It’s only in the last few years that researchers have delved into this aspect of Lincoln’s life. A family history of depression, “the Lincoln horrors.” Lincoln’s own conviction that he was constitutionally subject to melancholy, which he dubbed “my peculiar misfortune.” His frequent talk of suicide—there was a period when he didn’t dare carry a pocketknife for fear of using it to kill himself. Two major breakdowns, the first in his mid-twenties (the typical onset age for unipolar depression in men), the second in his early thirties. “I am now the most miserable man living,” he wrote at age 32. “If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would be not one happy face upon the earth.” Concerned friends removed razors from his room, mounted a suicide watch and feared for his sanity. In an effort to escape his misery, Lincoln underwent the standard medical treatment of the times—a weeklong torment that would have included starving, bleeding, dunking in icy water, purging with black pepper drinks, swallowing mercury, applying mustard rubs that burned the skin raw. He emerged emaciated, exhausted and, unsurprisingly, feeling worse than ever. Today’s medicine offers effective drugs and skilled counseling. If these methods had been available then, Lincoln might have been a less sad and tormented person. But would he have been as great? Here is the life-giving new insight Lincoln is bringing me. Many researchers today, looking afresh at Lincoln’s melancholia, are grateful that he was not “cured.” From his chronic depression may have come the coping skills, the realism, the wisdom that steered the nation through its greatest crisis. What strengths may depression have bestowed on our greatest president? Humor. Jokes and storytelling were Lincoln’s lifelong refuge from despair. As the casualty figures in the war mounted, grief threatened to overwhelm him. Far from a sign of callousness, his humor helped him bear the horrors he felt so deeply. “I laugh,” Lincoln told a disapproving member of his cabinet, “because I must not weep.” Humility. He had the modesty of a man continually aware of his own defects. In an age of swaggerers, this highest official in the land called himself “a man without a name.” Knowing his own failings, he could forgive those of others. As Northern leaders called for continual retribution from the defeated South, Lincoln appealed for “malice toward none.” Dedication to a great cause. It was the issue of slavery that pulled Lincoln back from the brink of suicide. Despairing of himself, he determined instead to devote his life to others. Dependence on God. “I am driven to my knees,” he said, “by the conviction that I have nowhere else to go.” He saw himself not as captain of the ship but as the humble helmsman, striving to steer as the true Captain directed. Humor, humility, service to others, faith—these are qualities, I think, that all of us aim at. That it was not despite his depression, but in part because of it, that Lincoln’s character developed as it did—this is the wondrous promise he holds out to people like me. His arena was a national one, mine one of family and neighbors. But the fact that God can use the negatives of our lives, even the blackness of depression, to shape us to his purposes—this is good news indeed!",,,,
MotivationalStory,Alikay Wood,Rebekah Lyons’ 6-Step Morning Routine to Reduce Anxiety,The author and speaker broke down how her morning habits help set her up for a worry-free day. ,"Rebekah Lyons wasn’t always a morning person. For years, the renowned author and speaker experienced panic attacks and severe anxiety.  But in the last few years, Lyons said the panic attacks faded. She said turning over her anxieties to God in surrender, plus having time alone in the morning, were “a game changer.”  “Morning routine sets the framework for the day,” Lyons said. “It's just absolutely essential.”  In her latest book, Rhythms of Renewal, Lyons chronicles just how routines and practices—what she calls rhythms—bring her peace.  “When we begin our days by spending time with God…it brings healing,” Lyons wrote in the book. “There’s no script, no race, no rules. There’s only peace, courage, and strength for the day ahead.”  Prior to this, she wrote about her experience battling panic attacks in the books Freefall to Fly and You Are Free, sharing how faith and prayer helped her face anxiety.  “The science and the research tells us that 77% of us in society are showing physical symptoms of stress,” Lyons told Guideposts.org. “The goal [of] my work has been to give tools and resources for people who feel discouragement or despair or they're hitting relapse moments and they're like, ‘Am I going to come out of it?’”  She goes into detail in Rhythms of Renewal on specific practices, such as a technology detox, exercise and taking a Sabbath, that can foster peace and a sense of calm.  But one of the most important tools for maintaining inner peace, Lyons said, is starting your day in an uplifting way. Here are the five steps to her morning routine:  1. Prepare the night before Lyons is well aware that getting up early is difficult. She has four children, two with special needs, and runs a business with her husband. She says establishing a morning routine you actually stick to requires committing to it the night before.  “I'll do a brain dump before I go to bed,” Lyons said. “I'll put those [thoughts] either in the notes app on my phone [or] a shared note with my assistant or someone on my team.”  Jotting things down helps Lyons sleep better and prevents her mind from compulsively running over her to-do list.  2. Start with water Lyons appreciates a steaming mug of coffee in the morning, but she found that starting her day with caffeine led to more anxiety. The solution? Drink water first.  “I drink 20 ounces of water first thing in the morning with fresh-squeezed lemon,” Lyons said. “It's a detoxifier and it's a really great way to hydrate yourself physically before you start drinking caffeine.”  3. Kneel and pray Lyons has done yoga for years and knows how child’s pose relaxes her heart and mind.  “Kneeling is a natural position for an exhale,” Lyons said. “It is a posture of surrender and release.”  The act of kneeling puts Lyons in a peaceful state of mind.  “I've found [kneeling helps to] slow my breathing,” Lyons said. “My central nervous system [is] able to calm down. I [am] able to think clearly about the things I need to lay down from yesterday so that I can begin anew today.”  4. Read encouraging liturgy and scripture Every day, Lyons read Scripture, usually focusing on the Psalms or something that will inspire her heart.  “Each morning I turn to God’s word, which nourishes my soul and fills me up after the previous day’s pouring out,” Lyons wrote in Rhythms of Renewal.  5. Journal your intention for the day Journaling is important for Lyons’ morning routine.  “[After] I lay down the cares and the burdens from yesterday I say, ‘Just help me to receive what you have for me today,’” Lyons said. Sometimes she’ll write down the name of a friend and some encouragement she wants to share with them that day.  “My prayer is that I don't miss an opportunity that presents itself right in front of me,” Lyons said. “That I would be a person who notices things and doesn't just barrel by.”  6. End your routine with gratitude “Scripture says that God's mercy is new every morning,” Lyons said. “It's like a gift.”  Lyons ends her morning routine by writing down specific things she is grateful to God for. Journaling her gratitude not only helps Lyons begin the day with a peaceful attitude, it also provides a record of God’s faithfulness.  Lyons understands that everyone’s morning routine will be different. The most important thing, she says, is to appreciate the gift of each day.  “You get to wake up with…a clean slate,” Lyons said. “Today is a new day. I want to start my day in a posture of surrender and release, so that I can be ready to receive.”",,,,
MotivationalStory,Glenn Close,Do You Know Someone Living with Mental Illness?,In this 2010 Guideposts story; actress Glenn Close shares what it’s like having a loved one who has bi-polar disorder and explains why we need to destigmatize mental illness.,"Grand Central Station. More than half a million people come through here every day, people of all ages and backgrounds, all walks of life. You can’t necessarily tell from the outside—the clothes they wear, the things they carry, even the way they act—what’s going on with someone inside—the struggles they face, the loneliness they feel, the hope and understanding they seek.  That’s why I’m here. I’ve learned that one in four adults has a mental illness—such as depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD or schizophrenia—and the stigma can be as daunting as the disease itself. I’m filming a public service announcement to get people talking openly about mental illness. Lights are set up, extension cords snake across the floor, thousands of voices echo beneath the vaulted ceiling. All at once I hear a lone voice through the din. “Ms. Close?” A woman I don’t know comes up to me. “Thank you,” she says, “for what you’ve done for the mentally ill.” Then a little more hesitantly, “We have mental illness in my family.”  I look at her, imagining the turmoil she and her family have been through. There is a lot I could say, but one thing in particular I want to know, as much for her as for me. “What kind of mental illness?” I ask.  Words are powerful. They can shroud a problem in secrecy or bring it into the bold light of day. I admire this woman’s courage for speaking out. Now I hope she can tell me, what specific diagnosis? If you can give something a name, you can stop being afraid of it and start dealing with it. I should know. There is mental illness in my own family.  I grew up in an idyllic corner of Connecticut, one of four kids. We lived right next to my grandmother’s house amidst acres of rolling fields. We would take the train to New York City and walk through Grand Central Station, dressed in our Sunday best, to go to the circus or get our eyes checked. If you look at photos of us from back then, we seem like the perfect family, healthy and happy. And in many ways, we were blessed. But there were also things that weren’t right, things that were rarely, if ever, spoken of.  Relatives who overindulged in alcohol. An uncle who took his own life. My maternal grandmother’s stays at a place called Silver Hill. She was kind and went to the church up the road on Sundays, except for those weeks she was “resting” at Silver Hill. I thought it was a spa of some sort (it looked like a spa). It wasn’t until years later that I discovered it was a psychiatric hospital. No one ever called it that and the reason she went there was one of those well kept family secrets.  My father was a doctor, a man dedicated to helping others—he spent years running a hospital in Africa. Yet we never dreamed of asking him what was wrong. We wouldn’t have known what to say. We didn’t have the vocabulary. Some things were too scary to talk about. My younger sister, Jessie, was bright and imaginative. She told magical stories, even as a little girl, and could completely lose herself in a book.  She also had a habit of rubbing the loose skin between her thumb and forefinger until it became raw and crusty. Odd behavior. Disturbing. But the adults around us never commented on it. Even when more obvious and ominous signs of trouble came in her teens—Jess got into alcohol and drugs—no one mentioned the possibility that she might be trying to blunt some unbearable psychological pain. Instead, we chalked her behavior up to her being “wild” and “original.”  Jess dropped out of school, overdosed a couple times, wrecked relationships, veering from dark spells to hyper-energetic highs. Yet she was a devoted mom to her three kids, and she never lost that incredible creative spark. She kept writing, even published a novel.  I was launching my acting career, rushing to auditions or rehearsals. If you asked me about mental illness back then, I would have pointed to the street people in the theater district. The man singing out-of-tune arias in front of Carnegie Hall. The bald fellow who drew hair on his head with a black marker and drummed on the sidewalk with a ragged pair of drumsticks. Celia, who hung out by the stage door, calling to me, “Miss Close, Miss Close, are you an actress?”  I played some deeply troubled characters. Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire, Norma Desmond in the musical version of Sunset Boulevard. And, of course, Alex Forrest in the movie Fatal Attraction.  When I was cast as Alex, one of the first things I did was have a psychiatrist look at the script. “Why would a woman behave like this?” I asked him. I didn’t want her to be a caricature. I wanted to understand her, empathize with her. The psychiatrist suggested Alex might have suffered some childhood trauma; others diagnosed borderline personality. Those insights helped me make the character real.  It might seem strange that I didn’t connect these psychological profiles to behavior patterns in my own family. But it wasn’t until nine years ago that the reality of mental illness hit home. Jess had been worried about her 19-year old son. “All I knew was Calen wasn’t Calen anymore” was the way she put it.  He finally opened up to her about the delusions he was having. He was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. He checked into McLean Hospital in Massachusetts for psychiatric treatment. At least Jess was doing well, I thought. She’d gotten sober with the help of a 12-step program. She seemed strong enough to face what was happening to her son.  Then Jess shook my world. One day she sat my mother and me down and said, “I need help.” I assumed she was talking about Calen. “I need help for myself,” she went on. “I should check into McLean too.” She said that in talking to Calen and his doctors about his illness, she’d been hit with the shock of recognition. She had some similar symptoms.  I took my sister to McLean. On the long drive there, we talked with an openness that brought an incredible sense of relief after a lifetime of keeping secrets. “I’m glad I’ve been sober for a while,” Jess said. “I couldn’t have done this without those years of AA .” Working the 12 steps, trusting in a Higher Power, had given her the courage to change.  I found myself rethinking generations of family history. My mom’s half-brother who’d committed suicide, why hadn’t anyone talked about depression? The relatives who lived for their cocktails, why didn’t we acknowledge they were alcoholics? My grandmother and her mysterious trips to Silver Hill. My sister with those red flags we had missed. Why couldn’t we speak up? Why were we in such denial? Though my family had a tradition of helping others, we had overlooked the help we needed for ourselves.  Jess’s doctor at McLean found medication that transformed her life. He put a name to what she suffers from: bipolar disorder. That explained her unusual emotional shifts from manic periods of euphoria and creativity to those deadening depressions she’s described as “sheer blackness.”  My sister and my nephew have become extraordinary advocates for people with mental illness. As Jess says, “I am not my disease.” She is simply someone who is being treated for a disease, an illness with a biological basis like cancer or diabetes.  Jess and Calen are my heroes. They have inspired me to take on a new role. First I got involved with the New York City-based organization Fountain House. They have a center where people with mental illness can go for help with education, jobs and housing and, most important, for community. I wanted to dig deep, as though I were researching a part.  I asked to volunteer with Fountain House’s members. Many sign up for vocational training and I was to arrange flowers with one group. At first, I’ll admit, I was a little wary. What was I going to say? But pretty soon, I realized I could talk about what I’d talk about with anyone—the weather, the flowers we were working with, the Mets.  Words that seemed scary—schizophrenic, depressive, bipolar—lost their power the more I heard them. That got me wondering if we could help remove the stigma from mental illness by talking openly about it. A group of us worked with several major mental health organizations and launched a national campaign, BringChange2Mind.org.  I asked Jess and Calen if they’d appear in a public-service announcement. They didn’t hesitate. Neither did my daughter Annie nor Jess’s daughter Mattie. (My mother said she wished she could be there too to make it three generations.) We brainstormed ideas about where to film, and kept coming back to Grand Central Station.  More than half a million people rushed through every day, thousands of them living with a mental illness. How many were suffering in silence, feeling isolated not just by their disease but also by the burden of keeping it a secret?  That’s why I asked the woman who stopped to talk to me about the specific diagnosis in her family. Acknowledge a problem, give it a name and you can deal with it. You can treat it. You can understand it. Recovery is possible. And that’s also why for the filming everyone in the PSA is wearing T-shirts that say who we are. No more hiding. No more distancing ourselves. No more secrets.  Calen’s shirt says “schizophrenic,” Jess’s says “bipolar,” Annie’s says “cousin,” Mattie’s says “sister” and so does mine. No one’s going to give me an Academy Award for it, but it’s my most important role.

MotivationalStory,Kevin Curry,How Cooking Helped Kevin Curry Confront His Depression,The chef and fitness expert used his struggles with depression and food to turn his life around and inspire others to do the same.,"I’d known her since middle school. That’s why I’d felt comfortable inviting myself over to her place that night. “Just thought we could catch up,” I’d told her, which wasn’t exactly true.  I had just picked out my hair, so my twists were a bit longer than usual; when wet they would hang nearly over my eyes. I flashed a big disarming smile. “I’m great,” I said. “Got some big projects coming up at work.”  Also, not exactly true. I was 28, a year out of Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, working in city government on a yearlong fellowship. To my family and friends, I was on the fast track. But inside I was tormented by dark, self-destructive thoughts I’d wrestled with since I was a kid. I was at least 30 pounds overweight. My latest girlfriend had essentially dumped me, saying she was “just moving on.” Not that I could blame her. My whole life, I’d kept everyone at arm’s length, never revealing the real me, making it hard to get close.  I’d been taught that my depression came from a lack of faith. Another way I was falling short. It made me angry at God. Why wouldn’t he help me? I’d decided to take matters in my own hands. This last get-together with my old friend was fitting. I only hoped, when it was all over, she and others would be able to forgive me, to understand that I could no longer live with the torment.  My dad had been the GM of a large automobile plant in Dallas. It provided a comfortable life for my mom and older brother, Chris, and me. My mom showed her love through her cooking: Southern favorites like fried catfish and cheese grits, and Cajun dishes from her Louisiana roots. A clean plate was both polite and customary.  We attended one of the city’s largest churches. Our minister preached that God poured out his blessings on the faithful. The evidence was all around us. We lived in a nice house. Chris and I went to a private school.  Then, when I was eight, my dad was diagnosed with a debilitating disease and went on permanent disability. My mom began working two jobs. And Chris and I were sent to public school, where I struggled to fit in from Day One.  The other kids made fun of my voice and the words I used. My dad was an English major, so at home he’d correct me and my brother if we got lax. My inability to code-switch at school made me an easy target. But by then, I was already a master actor. I could laugh and joke my way through the day while feeling I might implode at any moment.  I’d go home and straight to my room, filling notebooks with my angst. I hate that I’m so different. I’m always sad inside. Why can’t I rest?  In high school I found relief in an art class. There was one character I drew over and over again. A young black man in a T-shirt and blue jeans, whose dreads covered his face. I drew him in various fatal scenes. Lying in a pool of blood. Even hanging. I didn’t think of him as me. For one thing, my head was a shaved, clean college cut.  One day my dad found my drawings. All he could ask was, “What’s wrong?” My mother just sobbed.  I was ashamed and embarrassed. There was no talk of going to a therapist or a psychiatrist. In the black and church communities, there wasn’t much discussion about mental health. You were supposed to “go to God and lay it on the altar.” Only problem: I didn’t exactly know what to lay down, so I just repeatedly asked God to “make me feel better and not sad.” Between Dad being in and out of hospitals and Mom working to keep everything together, I didn’t want to be a bigger burden. I tried to live in the shadows.  I excelled at academics. I got a bachelor’s degree in business. Then Harvard for grad school. Boston is where things changed for me. The pressure to succeed was intense. And the cold, dark weather awakened something that had largely been dormant and contained—my depression. I started drinking almost every night. Then the 2008 stock market crash sent me right back to the place I thought I had escaped, literally and figuratively.  I’d been home with my parents for a year. My job wasn’t what I’d thought it would be. I felt stuck. I wasn’t sleeping. In desperation, I went to a Christian therapist; I saw her three times. Nothing changed, and our conversations were just on the surface. I’d skipped the past two appointments. I doubted she even cared. Soon enough that weekend, the torment, would be over. I’d even drawn lines on my arm to guide the razor blade. This get-together with my old friend was one of the last things on my list.  “So tell me what’s been up,” my friend said.  Just then my phone rang. “Kevin, apologies for calling out of the blue, but you’ve been on my mind this week. Will you come meet me tomorrow?”  My therapist. Worried about me? Her concern felt genuine. Like an answer to a cry for help. One I’d never uttered to anyone but God.  “Yes, tomorrow works,” I told her. The rest of the night was a blur—I kept thinking about the phone call.  The next day, after work, I went to my appointment. This meeting was different; the therapist was intent on digging deep. She asked about my drinking, my dreams, my mental health. Then she saw the lines on my arms. “Are you having thoughts of hurting yourself?”  When haven’t I? I thought. Those gruesome drawings from high school flashed through my mind; I hadn’t thought about those for more than 10 years. I started shaking when I realized that I now looked like the man in the drawings. There I sat in the office wearing a plain T-shirt and blue jeans, with long, picked-out twists. It was me I’d been drawing all along. I was broken. Through tears I said, “Lately, yeah, I’ve been thinking of actually doing it.”  “Kevin, let’s get you more help,” the therapist said. “There’s no shame in getting treatment. Depression is an illness. It’s not from a lack of faith or personal weakness.”  That’s not what I’d grown up believing. I thought my incessant depressive thoughts were from not trusting in God strongly enough, reminding me that I was disappointing him.  I went to a hospital and was discharged into the care of my parents. I told them everything. It was a difficult conversation, but simply being open and honest was incredibly freeing. As if I were seeing the world for the first time. I later met with a psychiatrist. He gave me further insight into depression and anxiety disorders, then prescribed an antidepressant.  My depression and anxiety were due to a host of things, from genetic vulnerability to stressful life events to a chemical imbalance in my brain. My perceived lack of faith was not a cause. With the help of medication, the sadness felt less overwhelming. I became more motivated to get in shape. To eat better. My prayers began to change. No longer did I ask God to fix me. There was a comfort now I’d never known before. An acceptance that I was exactly where I needed to be. Peace.  I’d never cooked anything but the simplest of meals: frozen chicken breast, canned green beans and instant brown rice. Now I searched the internet for healthier recipes and enjoyed discovering foods I never ate growing up (and could hardly pronounce), such as quinoa and arugula.  By now I’d gotten a new job, managing social media for a large computer company. I decided to post pictures of the dishes I was making on a Tumblr blog to build community around healthy food and get free advice on my diet.  One day I was at the gym when an older muscular white man came up to me. “Hey, I’m Greg,” he said. “What are you training for?”  I pulled out my earbuds. “Nothing,” I mumbled. “Just trying to lose some weight and gain muscle.”  “What’s your plan?”  My blank stare told him that I didn’t have one.  “I see that you work hard, but you have to have a plan if you want results,” Greg said.  I knew about strategic plans at work. I’d just never thought of applying the same principles to a workout routine.  Greg spent the rest of the hour working out with me, cheering me on each set and even showing me more exercises. He was like a personal trainer, but this was totally on his own. A guy I would have thought I had nothing in common with: twice my age, conservative politically, intense, a bodybuilder.  “I’ll see you tomorrow,” he said.  We worked out weekly. And equipped with a strategy, I started to see my body change faster. But it was also Greg, having someone to be accountable to.  I stopped using alcohol to medicate. Little by little, I grew more open with my friends and family. Depression only worsens when you keep it a secret.  And there was one surprising passion I found: cooking. Cooking focused me. I planned my grocery list, set out all the ingredients and utensils I’d be using. There was an order to how I prepared the foods. Having a plan made everything easier, smoother. I got daring and started experimenting and creating my own recipes.  I loved engaging with others, so I created an Instagram account called FitnessAndFaith. I posted words of inspiration and reflection along with photos of my journey in food. The account grew slowly, but that didn’t matter; I loved connecting with people.  One day I posted a photo of a banana split I’d made with Greek yogurt, granola, berries and chocolate chips. It went viral. I went from 10,000 followers to more than 100,000 in less than three months! People were turning to me for fitness tips, healthy meals that didn’t take a lot of work and a daily pick-me-up to stay positive.  Every day there were hundreds of messages, sometimes thousands—a connection I never could have imagined possible. I think it was because I was honest about my struggles with food and depression. I had come out of the shadows.  I changed the name of my Instagram to @fitmencook and, in 2014, left my job to pursue this newfound passion. Five years later, with more than two million social media followers, two best-selling apps (with over one million downloads) and a top-selling cookbook, I can say my passion hasn’t faded; it’s only grown stronger.  As has my faith, nourished in the light where it was once in darkness.",,,,
MotivationalStory,B'ette Schalk,How She Coped with Her Husband’s Depression,A wife shares how processing her grief helped her cope with her husband's mental illness.  ,"One dark, freezing January morning four years ago, I drove to the hospital here in the city of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, to say goodbye to my husband, Herb. He was being taken to the only long-term psychiatric facility in the province, some four hours away, in North Battleford. I watched as he was strapped onto a gurney for the ambulance. “I’ll miss you,” I told him. “More than you know.” I was hoping for some sign that he heard me, but he was too sedated to even speak. I gave him a kiss that I knew would have to last a long time. Then the ambulance pulled out of the parking lot, and I followed it for miles through the darkness, until I lost sight of it at a four-way stop. It felt as if I were following a hearse, my husband gone to me forever.  In the fall of 2000, I hadn’t seen any of this coming. Herb had had surgery on his shoulder, which left him unable to do chores on our small farm in rural Saskatchewan for months. The bills kept coming, so we sold our cattle and rented out the farm to neighbors. By the time Herb recovered, we’d decided not to buy into the cattle business again, and he was hired to help with the seeding on our land. I thought it was a good solution, but Herb fell into a cycle of anxiety alternating with depression.  “I feel like less of a man working my own land for wages,” he said. Gone was the vibrant man I’d fallen in love with and married 24 years earlier, the man who liked going to parties and playing cards, who could crack me up with his dry wit. Instead of taking care of things on the farm, Herb sprawled on the couch, staring at the ceiling. He’d always been such a neat and stylish dresser that I’d called him Mr. Perfect, but here he was moping around, slovenly and unshaven.  Before my marriage, I had worked as a psychiatric nurse, and I was sure God was giving me a chance to use my training. I thought Herb had situational depression, that I could heal him. I held his hand and encouraged him to share his feelings. “Let’s see if we can turn those thoughts into something positive,” I told him. “There’s not one positive thing in my life,” he said, looking down at the floor. When he was anxious, I tried to calm him by saying, “Just focus on the present moment.” “But the present is unbearable,” he said, following me from room to room, wringing his hands and crying.  Nothing I did made a difference. Several times Herb was admitted to the community hospital for his own safety. His pacing and pleas for someone to end his pain disturbed other patients, so he was kept sedated. I realized he needed more help than I could give, more than our rural hospital could provide. The closest hospital with a psychiatric unit where Herb could get regular care was in Moose Jaw, about five hours away. It was too expensive to travel back and forth. Our only option was to move to the city. By the grace of God, in the fall of 2004, we found a house we could afford just minutes from the hospital. I got a job as an assistant nurse in an extended care facility for seniors.  In the years that followed, Herb was rushed to the psychiatric unit many times. I lost track of how often the police responded to 911 calls because Herb told the operator, “I can’t live like this anymore.” I was terrified to leave him alone. I even changed my work schedule so that I could be with him during the day. I’d work the overnight shift, come home and sleep for a few hours until he got up at noon, then start the cycle all over again. Every time I had to get groceries or go to an appointment with my own doctor, I’d say, “I need to leave the house for a bit. Will you be all right?”  I would pray that he would be okay, but I’d often come home to find Herb had called 911. His psychiatrist put him on more pills, different pills. Herb underwent electroconvulsive shock therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation. He would be released from the psychiatric unit feeling better, but the respite never lasted. Within six weeks, he would suffer a relapse of depression.  By the time Herb was sent to the long-term psychiatric facility in North Battleford, in 2015, I’d been fighting his demons for more than 15 years, and I knew I’d reached my limit. I was like the proverbial frog in the pot of hot water: I didn’t realize I was boiling until the heat had been turned all the way up. I called once a week to check on Herb, but I mostly spoke to the nurses. I didn’t talk to Herb much; it left him agitated and me in tears. I couldn’t even bring myself to visit him for the first several months because I was afraid they’d make me take him home when he wasn’t really well yet. Then I felt guilty for thinking that.  My sister urged me to join a grief group at the hospital in Moose Jaw. “You need to work through your feelings,” she said.  “Grief counseling when nobody has died is ridiculous,” I said. My sister kept pushing. Six weeks after Herb went to North Battleford, I decided to attend one meeting to get her off my back. Just one.  In the meeting room, a dozen chairs were arranged in a circle. I wanted the chair closest to the door so I could slip out, but a woman snagged it. The facilitator introduced herself as Ellen.  We went around the circle, sharing why we were there. One man had lost his daughter in a drowning. Another was grieving the death of his wife. Then it was my turn. Would everyone wonder why I was here when my loved one was still alive? “My husband is in long-term psychiatric care,” I said. To my surprise, people nodded sympathetically. It turned out that four of the 12 were dealing with problems other than death. Judy, the woman who’d taken that chair by the door, said she was grieving the loss of her childhood after having to care for her younger siblings. She looked to be in her sixties, like me.  Ellen pointed to a basket of rocks on the table in the center of our circle. “Everyone, take two rocks,” she said. “Now I want you to write in permanent marker a feeling you want to keep on one rock, and on the other, in washable ink, a feeling you want to get rid of.”  I wrote “hope” on one because hope was all I had left, not that there was much of it at this point. I wrote “resentment” on the other rock. Ellen asked us to explain the feelings we’d written on our rocks. “I resent Herb for…leaving me,” I managed to say. “That he’s not around for our children and grandchildren. That I have to take care of everything.” It was hard to get the words out, but it was a relief too.  Ellen wrote on a whiteboard the five stages of grief: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. “You might hit the stages at different times and in a different order,” she told us, “and some stages may resonate with you more than others.”  When the first session was over, our group went out for coffee. We chatted about what we’d learned that night, and I knew then I would be coming back. I felt supported by these strangers already. Judy leaned in close and asked what the last straw had been for me. “When I found Herb banging his head against the wall in the hallway, repeating, ‘I can’t take this anymore’ with every bang,” I said. That was when I’d realized we had to leave the farm and move to the city, where he could get better care.  The next week, our group tackled the stage of anger. Boy, did I have a lot to say then! I was angry at Herb for leaving me to clean up the mess his illness had made of our lives. I was angry that neither he nor most of our friends and family seemed to understand what I’d been going through all these years, caring for him and worrying that he’d take his life. I was angry at myself. Maybe things would have been different if I’d recognized right away that Herb was suffering something far deeper than situational depression. I was angry with the people who said I should let go of Herb and move on with my life.  Finally, I was angry that my faith was being tested so severely. I told the group about Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel: Nebuchadnezzar had lived with madness for seven years before God rescued him. I said to God, “You gave Nebuchadnezzar back his sanity, and I want the same for Herb!” I asked why Herb—and I—had to suffer so much longer. But maybe even God was tired of me begging for help.  The stage of depression too hit home for me. The constant roller coaster of caring for Herb had taken its toll. I was a bag of nerves and even experienced brief bouts of depression myself. I couldn’t imagine what it was like for Herb, sinking into that dark pit of despair with no end in sight. “Laugh, and the world laughs with you; weep, and you weep alone,” the poem may go, but not so in the group. I was so burned-out that I thought I couldn’t even cry anymore, but I found myself in tears over their stories. I felt their pain, and I knew that they could feel mine. Thank goodness we could express our feelings in the group and not be judged. For the first time in a long time, I actually felt my feelings instead of pushing them down.  For homework, Ellen asked us to write down the warm memories we had with our loved one. At first, all I could think of were the encounters with the police and being afraid to leave Herb alone, for fear he’d kill himself. I had to really pretzel my thinking into the positive to remember the good things: the births of our three children, farm parties and playing cards with friends, trips to the lake on summer afternoons. The more I wrote about happy times, the more I was able to see how blessed I’d been to have had so many good years with Herb. He’d been such a devoted husband and father.  The last stage, acceptance, I struggled with. What if Herb never got better? What if he never came home? I might have to live without the man I loved for the rest of my life. I might end up alone, no one sharing my golden years, no one to sit with in our rocking chairs and enjoy visits from our grandchildren. How could I accept that? I talked about how I’d felt I was experiencing a death of some kind when I was following the ambulance that took Herb away from me. The group helped me see that it was the end of my life as I knew it and, by acknowledging that, I was already in the process of accepting it.  Shortly after I’d begun the grief group, our son, Ray, invited me to go to his church with his family. I met the Young at Heart, a group of seniors who invited me to potluck suppers and to game and movie nights. The Young at Heart surrounded me with God’s love, and I felt encouraged to hope again for the future, no matter how uncertain.  At the end of the eight weeks of the grief group, we walked to the bridge behind the hospital and flung our rocks with the feelings we wanted to let go of into the water. I watched as my “resentment” sank to the bottom and made ripples radiating to the bank. I felt more at peace than I had in years.  Herb had been in North Battleford for a year when he called me and was able to carry on a conversation. He’d been put on a new combination of medications, and it was as if a switch had flipped. He asked about our family, something he hadn’t shown interest in for years. At last, after 20 months away, he came home. More than two and a half years later, he hasn’t had a single relapse. We’ve both changed under the weight of all those years he was ill, but for the most part, the kind and spirited man I married has been returned to me, the loving husband and doting father and grandfather. Now he’s the one who keeps the list of family and friends’ birthdays and anniversaries, making sure we don’t miss out on anything. He even carries on with our children on Facebook.  We hold hands and pray aloud together every morning. We pray for those we know who need God’s intervention, and then we say, “Thank you for our physical and mental health.” We know that we are not promised these precious things forever, but Herb and I are filled with gratitude for the present.",,,,
